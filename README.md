# biodiversity_visualizations
## Biodiversity Analysis Project

## Description
This repository contains materials for an in-class project on biodiversity, conducted as a part of the Information Visualization course at Drexel University. Our team has used a combination of Tableau, R, GGplot, and Raw Graphs to explore, analyze, and visualize the impacts of human activities on global biodiversity.

## Project Objective
The main objective of this project was to use visualization techniques to convey the state and trends of global biodiversity, specifically addressing the impact of human activities such as deforestation, changes in land use, and agricultural production. We also explored the contribution of different sectors to global greenhouse gas emissions and how these have changed over time.

Through this project, we aimed to deliver a comprehensive understanding of the complexity of the global biodiversity scenario, shedding light on where targeted efforts are needed to preserve the planet's natural heritage.

## Tools Used
1. **Tableau**: For building interactive visualizations and dashboards.
2. **R and GGplot**: For data cleaning, analysis, and creating static visualizations.
3. **Raw Graphs**: For creating web-based, vector graphics.

## Contributing
This project is the culmination of the collaborative efforts of Kevin Mastascusa and Alexis Tibbs, students of Information Visualization at Drexel University. We welcome and appreciate any feedback or suggestions to improve the quality of this project.
